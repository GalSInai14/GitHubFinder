<h1>GitHub Finder</h1>
<h2>Find repositories and GitHub users on GitHub Finder App!</h2>
<p>GitHub Finder is a platform that enables Git users to find desirable repositories and creators.
I built the platform using React, integrated it with 3rd party APIs such as Git, and designed the UI components.
